In this folder, you find four videos generated with the Peter Corke's Matlab Robotics Toolbox. They are related to the four simulation cases described in the root folder, in particular:

Video 1: no secondary cost index.

Video 2: manipulability measure as secondary cost index. 
 
Video 3: distance from joint limits as secondary cost index.
 
Video 4: hybrid secondary cost index.

Notice how the redundancy is well exploited: in fact, the four cartesian trajectories are practically the same (considerations on the cartesian error can be found in the root folder and running the code), while the joint trajectories are different.
